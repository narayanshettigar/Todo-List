# Todo-List

This is a simple Todo List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of Bootstrap for styling. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

# Demo Link

# Functionality
Upon opening the application, users are presented with an empty list of tasks. They can add a task by typing into the input field labeled "Add Todo" and clicking the "Add" button. The task will then be displayed in the list with a checkbox to its left, and a "Delete" button to its right.

Users can mark a task as completed by checking the box next to it. Completed tasks will be crossed out and displayed with a gray background.

Users can delete a task by clicking the "Delete" button next to it. This will remove the task from the list entirely.

All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they will persist even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

# Usage
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
